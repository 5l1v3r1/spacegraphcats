    "\n",
    "From the 6/29 phone call, we wanted to know what \"perfect\" looked like - what can we recover when we look at the original graph with the full query, vs the contracted De Bruijn graph with the MinHash query?\n",
    "\n",

    "* B is the original DBG;\n",
    "* G is the contracted De Bruin graph;\n",
    "* T is the target subset of the original De Bruijn graph;\n",
    "* M is the MinHash sketch of T;\n",
    "\n",
    "the question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we search G for T using M what is our performance? How close can we get to the \"perfect\" results of searching B (the original DBG) with T directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** the sensitivity and specifity below are in terms of k-mers in B, not nodes in G. This is different from how we've been doing the other benchmarking; I'll go fix those scripts if that's what we want (which seems likely)."

    "\n",
    "In order to compare search results against ground truth, we need to label the nodes in the graph with their origin. That is, we need to know which parts of B belong to the\n",
    "target subset T.  This is easy in B but requires a bit of work in G, where we have to label\n",

    "We have two types of nodes in the contracted De Bruijn graph implementation: high degree nodes and linear segments. The high degree nodes are always a single k-mer (and are size 1). Linear segments represent linear regions of the graph and can be size 1 or larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "CTB's initial labeling of the graph only labeled the high degree nodes, which was easy to implement.  However, these high degree nodes represent only a small portion of B, which is mostly linear. So, more recently, CTB added a `--label-linear-segments` (and also a `--no-label-hdn`) to `walk-dbg.py`, so that we can select whether we label only hdn nodes (default), all nodes (`--label-linear-segments`, or only linear segments `--label-linear-segments --no-label-hdn`) - note that for most purposes, we *don't* want to label linear segments, because it's slow, but for true benchmarking, we need to.\n"
